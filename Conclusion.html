            <u><h1>CONCLUSION</h1></u>
            <p>
                Patients visited mostly in the summer and autumn months, with a decline in number during the winter months.
                Out of all the patients that mentioned their race, the majority were White, with African-Americans coming in at second. 
                This can be interpreted as a reflection of the population in general in the chosen geographic region.
                For a majority of the patients, the General Practice department was referred. 
                The orthopaedic speciality was second most referred.
                Average satisfaction score was 5.47, which is around half of the top score. 
                Average wait time was around 35 minutes, a fact that might have led to the low satisfaction score. 
                Wait time was generally not dependent on any factor like age or race.
